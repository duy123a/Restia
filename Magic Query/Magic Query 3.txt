Yes, you can use multiple WITH clauses in a SQL query. When you use multiple common table expressions (CTEs), they need to be defined in a single WITH clause, but you can define multiple CTEs within that clause by separating them with commas.

Here's an example of how to structure multiple CTEs:

sql

WITH CTE1 AS (
    -- First CTE query
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM Table1
    WHERE some_condition
),
CTE2 AS (
    -- Second CTE query
    SELECT column3, column4
    FROM Table2
    WHERE some_other_condition
),
CTE3 AS (
    -- Third CTE query
    SELECT column5, column6
    FROM Table3
    WHERE another_condition
)
-- Main query using CTEs
SELECT *
FROM CTE1
JOIN CTE2 ON CTE1.column1 = CTE2.column3
JOIN CTE3 ON CTE2.column4 = CTE3.column5;
